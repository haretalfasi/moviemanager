# Movie Manager
A movie management SPA in AngularJS

Having just completed Todd Motto's AngularJS Pro (AMAZING COURSE!) and reading his AngularJS styleguide, I thought I'd put everything I learned into practise by creating a movie manager with a similar feel to the Plex Desktop App.

Being new to Github as well, I'd like to utilise it for version control while learning how to use it better :)
